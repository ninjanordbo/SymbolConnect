
# Symbolconnect, a symbol-based communication app.
Some children may not be able to use speech effectively, or at all, and may need to learn other ways to communicate. These children can express themselves by pointing at a symbol that represents what they want to say. By using symbols, these children are able to communicate their needs, wants, and ideas.

## Technologies used for the project

The app was made possible by the use of ARASAAC's pictorgaphic symbol API. The app was built using html, css and javascript. 

## Optimizations

It would be interesting to add user login to this app in the future. Maybe also drag and drop functionality so that users could make up sentences with symbols. 

## Lessons Learned:

We learned quite a lot during this project. We started out with the intention of building our own symbol API, but once we found a very extensive API we could use for this project we decided to use that instead. As neither one of us knew much about symbol-based communication we also had to do quite a bit of research on the subject. We wanted the app to be very simple and straight forward to use, and decided to use local storage for saved items.
